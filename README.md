## My process
1. Design was first carefully analyzed with the desktop view
2. HMTL elements were created and containers were strategically placed
3. Worked on the style sheet per container prioritizing to use flex
4. Design was then carefully analyzed with the mobile view
5. Built a media query where some CSS styles were modified to make the card responsive

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development
As I have carefully practiced CSS Grid in this challenge, I plan on practicing making my web page more responsive next.
